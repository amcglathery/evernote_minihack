Web app for geotagging notes using google maps

## Problem

Any note written on an Evernote desktop does not get autotagged with a
geotag. Additionally, if someone wants to manually geotag their notes, they
have to know the latitude and logitude of the location they wrote the note.

## Solution

We create a webapp that allows users to drag their ungeotagged notes onto
a google maps map to add getotags to them
